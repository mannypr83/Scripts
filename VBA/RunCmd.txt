Public Class MyUtilities
    Shared Sub RunCommandCom(command as String, arguments as String, permanent as Boolean) 
        Dim p as Process = new Process() 
        Dim pi as ProcessStartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo() 
        pi.Arguments = " " + if(permanent = true, "/K" , "/C") + " " + command + " " + arguments 
        pi.FileName = "cmd.exe" 
        p.StartInfo = pi 
        p.Start() 
    End Sub
End Class

call, for example, in this way:

MyUtilities.RunCommandCom("DIR", "/W", true)

EDIT: For the multiple command on one line the key are the & | && and || command connectors

    A & B -> execute command A, then execute command B.
    A | B -> execute command A, and redirect all it's output into the input of command B.
    A && B -> execute command A, evaluate the errorlevel after running Command A, and if the exit code (errorlevel) is 0, only then execute command B.
    A || B -> execute Command A, evalutate the exit code of this command and if it's anything but 0, only then execute command B.
